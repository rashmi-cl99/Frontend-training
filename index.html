            <span class="font-weight-bold">Ans: </span> The Internet simply moves data from one place to another, so that we can chat, browse and share. Data moves over the Internet in a manner called packet switching. What packet switching basically does is send your data in separate pieces â€“ each tagged with your intended destination.

            <span class="font-weight-bold">Ans: </span> HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages. The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.

            <span class="font-weight-bold">Ans: </span> A browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web, including Web pages, images, video and other files. As a client/server model, the browser is the client run on a computer that contacts the Web server and requests information. The Web server sends the information back to the Web browser which displays the results on the computer or other Internet-enabled device that supports a browser.

            <span class="font-weight-bold">Ans: </span> Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This is necessary because, although domain names are easy for people to remember, computers or machines, access websites based on IP addresses.

          <p class="display-5">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Ans: </span> A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.
